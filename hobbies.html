              <h3>Here is a list of my hobbies.</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Tennis</li>
                    <p>I like playing tennis because of its need for stragety, quick thinking, and strength.</p>
                <li>Video Games</li>
                    <p>I find video games entertaining due to their action and their ability to eliminate stress.</p>
                <li>Computer Science</li>
                    <p>The ability to create is fascinating to me, and computer science allows me to do that quickly, and having my creations accessed by many.</p>
                <li>Robotics</li>
                    <p>I've always liked movies like Transformers and Iron Man, and I find robotics interesting due to its potential to recreate them.</p>
                <li>Science</li>
                    <p>Science propels our world, and its ability to explain everything is interesting to me, and I wish to pursue it.</p>
                <li>Reading</li>
                    <p>Fiction is able to create worlds that some couldn't imagine without help, and I enjoy delving into those worlds.</p>
